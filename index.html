Less than five years after the signing of the treaty of Waitangi these attempts faced widespread disapproval, but after 27 years of war against the native population (often using the native tribal rivalries against each other) the colonial forces subjugated the majority of the country, and by 1875 the tribes had utterly ceded national control to the British parliament, who punitively confiscated thousands of acres of native tribal land. Two years later, they abolished the provincial states governing local areas, and for five years already the parliament had established a debt based currency privately invested by foreign merchants they used for public works, as well as permitting banks to offer private loans to flood the economy, and while claiming to be for the benefit of the people and creation of wealth their efforts had instead created a soft depression by indebting us to Britain, subjugating us to Britain and primarily exporting our produce to Britain all for Britain's benefit and all for our detriment.</p><p>That depression lasted almost three decades and New Zealand has never fully recovered from it to this day, and since this time New Zealand has merely limped along, stunted by the dramatic mismanagement of the nation by everyone given a chance to do so.</p><p>At no time has the New Zealand parliament ever sought, nor has it ever received the consent of the governed. At no point has the New Zealand parliament ever ratified a codified constitution, coming the closest with the Imperial Laws Application Act (1988) which among other features prevented the Magna Carta (1215) from applying to the colony completely, and then two years later effectively replacing that with the Bill of Rights Act (1990). However, this bill not only contradicted itself, but was doubly contradicted again three years later with the Harmful Digital Communications Act (1993) and the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act (1993). It is a human right defined by New Zealand law that any person in the country has the right to free expression, 
including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form. Yet, simultaneously, the same legislation provides sentencing guidelines for criminal speech. The following bill expanded any opinion or message published online and considered offensive to be considered criminal speech, and the bill after that created the New Zealand Office of Censorship and described the head position of Chief Censor, an authority with the power to criminalise the possession and distribution of any publication or media they choose, for any reason they see fit.</p><p>The stewards of this land have failed us. They have been conquered in war and corrupted by power. Their inability to manage this nation has stranded the citizens without any legal recourse against a government they don't approve of, one that doesn't care about human rights and has only made it this far by lying, begging, borrowing and stealing. The time is long past for we the people to take our lives into our own hands, to refuse to kneel before unjust tyranny. The state of our country is intolerable, so please, join me in my intolerance. Prepare yourself for the conflict that must occur to remove the powerful, as they will not relinquish it willingly, and forgive the useful idiots, for they know not what they do.<br></p><p>Any questions? Head to the 'Ask' page and check out the FAQ, if your question isn't answered there let me know, I'll get back to you as soon as possible, or head to the 'About' page to read my mission statement, and the changes I believe necessary for positive development. If you're already on board and want to prepare yourself, head to the 'Shop' page where you can find necessary equipment packages at cost price, or head to the 'Train' page to find freely available information as well as reserve places at a training camp retreat to learn how to use standard issue equipment and basic self defence martial art skills. If you want to help but are unable to afford equipment, to book a training placement or to make any donation, please head to the 'Support' page to learn how you can help your country with nothing but your time and effort which is infinitely more valuable than any donation.<br></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
